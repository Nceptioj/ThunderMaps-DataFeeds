# This example shows how to take the newest data from an updating data feed and post it to ThunderMaps,
# while caching which data has already been posted to ThunderMaps.
# It should be used for a data feed that doesn't provide the ability to specifiy the start date for the data returned.
# 
#This example uses a Portland 911 Dispatch RSS feed.
